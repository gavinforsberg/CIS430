Gavin Forsberg - Lab 2 Questions

1) What is the IP address of www.bradley.edu? 
- IP Address of Bradley University: 52.2.159.182
2) Do you see www.bradley.edu in the captured data frame? If not, what do you see? 
- www.bradley.edu does show up in the captured data frame as the 'host'. This is underneath the get request. 
3) What is the size of this data frame? 
- 414 bytes captured 
4) In the same data frame, how many bytes are transmitted in the application layer (HTTP)?
- File Data: 178 bytes 
5) How many "GET"' requests are there to fetch the whole content (including text, images, etc) in this page? 
- Two total get requests. "GET / HTTP/1.1." and "GET /js/script.js HTTP/1.1". 
6) What does it mean when receiving "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"?
- 200 is a status code for HTTP meaning that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. Standard for HTTP.
7) How many "GET" requests are required to fetch the content in this page? 
- There is only one GET request this time. 
8) What can you observe (in terms of differences) from the exercises 1-2 and 1-3?
- The overall data seems a lot smaller and especially when following the data. It also has a 304 status code for "not modified." There is no reason to retransmit the data since it hasn't changed.
