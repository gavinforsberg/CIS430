- Yes, I see HTTP/1.1 200 OK as the first thing returned. 

2) What is the last modified date/time? 
- The last modified date/time is Mon, 05 Oct 2020 01:42:52 GMT. 

3) In terminal, telnet replies "unable to connect to remote host. In Wireshark, the info says HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified. 

4) What is the code you see this time in the command prompt/capture? Do you still get 200 OK? 
- In the command prompt, telnet replies it is unable to connect to the address 136.176.85.152: operation time out. Unable to connect to remote host. In the WireShark capture, within the HTTP entries, when I follow the HTTP stream, it says 304 not modified status code once again.
